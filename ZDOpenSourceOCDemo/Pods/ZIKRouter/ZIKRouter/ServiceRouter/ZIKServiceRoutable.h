/**
 Protocols inheriting from ZIKServiceRoutable can be used to fetch service router with ZIKServiceRouterToService().
 @discussion
 ZIKServiceRoutable is for:
 1. Let module declare routable protocol in header as the module's provided interface
 1. Checking whether declared protocol is correctly supported in it's service router
 
 It's safe to use objc protocols inheriting from ZIKServiceRoutable with ZIKServiceRouterToService() and won't get nil. ZIKServiceRouter will validate all ZIKServiceRoutable protocols and registered protocols when app launchs and ZIKROUTER_CHECK is enbled.
