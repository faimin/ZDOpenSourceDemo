/**
 Protocols inheriting from ZIKServiceModuleRoutable can be used to fetch service router with ZIKServiceRouter.toModule().
 @discussion
 ZIKServiceModuleRoutable is for:
 1. Let module declare routable protocol in header as the module's provided interface
 1. Checking whether declared protocol is correctly supported in it's service router
 
 It's safe to use objc protocols inheriting from ZIKServiceModuleRoutable with ZIKServiceRouter.toModule() and won't get nil. ZIKServiceRouter will validate all ZIKServiceModuleRoutable protocols and registered protocols when app launchs and ZIKROUTER_CHECK is enbled.
