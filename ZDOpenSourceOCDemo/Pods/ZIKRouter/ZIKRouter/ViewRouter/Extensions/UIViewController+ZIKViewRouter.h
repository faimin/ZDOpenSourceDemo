 If a UIViewController is first appear, zix_routed will be NO in -viewWillAppear: and -viewDidAppear: (before [super viewDidAppear:], after [super viewDidAppear:], it's YES). If a UIViewController is removing, zix_routed will be NO in -viewDidDisappear:. When a UIViewController is displaying (even invisible), that means it's routed, zix_routed is YES.
