@interface UIView (ZIKViewRouter)

/**
 Check UIView is routed or not, then determine a UIView is first appear or is removing from superview. Routed means the UIView is added to a superview and appeared once. This property is for all UIView. The implementation is in ZIKViewRouter.
 @discussion
 If a UIView is adding to superview, -willMoveToSuperview:newSuperview will be called, newSuperview is not nil. If a UIView is removing from superview, -willMoveToSuperview:nil will be called.
 
 If view is first appear, zix_routed will be NO in -willMoveToSuperview:, -didMoveToSuperview, -willMoveToWindow:, -didMoveToWindow (before [super didMoveToWindow], after [super didMoveToWindow], it's YES). If view is removing from superview, zix_routed will be NO in -willMoveToSuperview: and -didMoveToSuperview, but it's still YES in -willMoveToWindow: and -didMoveToWindow. When a UIView has appeared once, that means it's routed, zix_routed is YES.

 @return If the UIView is already routed, return YES, otherwise return NO.

 A performer must be a UIViewController, and is custom class, rather than classes from system's frameworks. Search the UIViewController and UIView in nextResponder and parentViewController/superview 's nextResponder.
 @return a UIViewController who add this view as it's subview. return nil when this view is not in any superview or view controller of custom class.
