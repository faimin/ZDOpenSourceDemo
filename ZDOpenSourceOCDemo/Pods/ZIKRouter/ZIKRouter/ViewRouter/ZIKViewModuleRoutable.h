/**
 Protocols inheriting from ZIKViewModuleRoutable can be used to fetch view router with ZIKRouterToViewModule().
 @discussion
 When a view module is not only a single UIViewController, but also with other services and models, then you can't prepare the module's models and services with a simple view protocol. Now you need a module config protocol, and let router prepare the module inside.
 
 It's safe to use objc protocols inheriting from ZIKViewModuleRoutable with ZIKRouterToViewModule() and won't get nil. When ZIKROUTER_CHECK is enbled, ZIKViewRouter will validate all ZIKViewModuleRoutable protocols when registration is finished, then we can make sure all routable module protocols have been registered with a router.
