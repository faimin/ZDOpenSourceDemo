/**
 Abstract superclass for view router.
 Subclass it and override those methods in `ZIKRouterInternal` and `ZIKViewRouterInternal` to make router of your view.
 
 @discussion
 ## Features:
 
 1. Find router subclasses with registered protocols.
 
 2. Support all transition types in UIKit, and can remove the destination without using -popViewControllerAnimated:/-dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:/removeFromParentViewController/removeFromSuperview in different sistuation. Router can choose the proper method.
 
 3. Support storyboard. UIViewController and UIView from a segue can auto create it's registered router.
 
 4. Error checking for routing.
 
 5. AOP support for destination's route action.
 
 ## About auto create:
 
 When a UIViewController conforms to ZIKRoutableView, and is routing from storyboard segue or from -instantiateInitialViewController, a router will be auto created to prepare the UIViewController. If the destination needs preparing (+destinationPrepared: returns NO), the segue's performer is responsible for preparing in delegate method -prepareDestinationFromExternal:configuration:. But if a UIViewController is displayed from code manually, ZIKViewRouter won't auto create router, only get AOP notify, because we can't find the performer to prepare the destination. So if you use a router as a dependency injector for preparing the UIViewController, you should avoid display the UIViewController instance from code manually.
 
 When Adding a registered UIView by code or xib, a router will be auto created. We search the view controller of custom class (not system class like native UINavigationController, or any container view controller) in it's responder hierarchy as the performer. If the registered UIView needs preparing (+destinationPrepared: returns NO), you have to add the view to a superview in a view controller before it's removed from superview. There will be an assert failure if there is no view controller to prepare it (such as: 1. add it to a superview, and the superview is never added to a view controller; 2. add it to a UIWindow). If your custom class view use a routable view as it's subview, the custom view should use a router to add and prepare the routable view, then the routable view doesn't need to search performer because it's already prepared.

 1. Router is not performed yet.
 
 2. Destination was already poped/dismissed/removed/dealloced.
 
 3. Use ZIKViewRouteTypeCustom and the router didn't provide removeRoute, or -canRemoveCustomRoute return NO.
 
 4. If route type is adaptative type, it will choose different presentation for different situation (ZIKViewRouteTypePerformSegue, ZIKViewRouteTypeShow, ZIKViewRouteTypeShowDetail). Then if it's real route type is not Push/PresentModally/PresentAsPopover/AddAsChildViewController, destination can't be removed.
 
 5. Router was auto created when a destination is displayed and not from storyboard, so router don't know destination's state before route, and can't analyze it's real route type to do corresponding remove action.
 
 6. Destination's route type is complicated and is considered as custom route type. Such as destination is added to a UITabBarController, then added to a UINavigationController, and finally presented modally. We don't know the remove action should do dismiss or pop or remove from it's UITabBarController.
 
 @note Router should be removed be the performer, but not inside the destination. Only the performer knows how the destination was displayed (situation 6).

 @return return YES if can do removeRoute.
