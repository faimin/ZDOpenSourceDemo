/**
 Protocols inheriting from ZIKViewRoutable can be used to fetch view router with ZIKViewRouterToView().
 @discussion
 ZIKViewRoutable is for:
 1. Let module declare routable protocol in header as the module's provided interface
 1. Checking whether declared protocol is correctly supported in it's view router
 
 It's safe to use objc protocols inheriting from ZIKViewRoutable with ZIKViewRouterToView() and won't get nil. ZIKViewRouter will validate all ZIKViewRoutable protocols and registered protocols when app launchs and ZIKROUTER_CHECK is enbled.
