Buglife is an awesome bug reporting SDK & web platform for iOS apps.
For more info, visit [Buglife.com](https://www.buglife.com).

In a hurry? Try out our [iOS Demo project](https://github.com/Buglife/Buglife-iOS-Demo)!

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate Buglife into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Buglife'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

1. [Download the Buglife SDK](https://www.buglife.com/download-ios-sdk)

2. Unzip it & pull `Buglife.framework` into the Frameworks group in your project. In the following dialog box, make sure you have "Copy items if needed" checked.

## Code

1. Import the Buglife framework header into your app delegate.

    ```swift
    // Swift
    import Buglife
    ```
    
    ```objective-c
    // Objective-C
    #import <Buglife/Buglife.h>
    ```

2. Add the following to your app delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.
	
	```swift
	// Swift
	Buglife.shared().start(withEmail: "you@yourdomain.com")
	```
	```objective-c
	// Objective-C
	[[Buglife sharedBuglife] startWithEmail:@"you@yourdomain.com"];
	```
	Be sure to replace `you@yourdomain.com` with your own email address; this is where bug reports will be sent to.
	
## Usage

Build & run your app. Once your app is running, shake your device (\^âŒ˜Z in the simulator) to report a bug! Bug reports are sent directly to your email address.

Buglife offers numerous customizations & advanced features, including:

* Different invocation methods (i.e. hook into device screenshots to report a bug)
* Custom attachments
* Programmatic view blurring
* QA Mode
* String customization
* Automatic + manual user email collection

And more. Check out the Buglife [documentation page](https://www.buglife.com/docs) for more info!
